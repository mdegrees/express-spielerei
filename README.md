# Express Spielerei

I was playing around a bit with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/).

Here is what I wanted to test out ..

- setting up a web server
- using a view engine
- accepting `get` and `post` requests to different routes
- storing some data server-side
- deploying all to [Heroku.com](https://heroku.com)

Install it locally by doing ..

```
$ npm install
```

.. and start the app via ..

```
$ npm start
```

## See it live?
